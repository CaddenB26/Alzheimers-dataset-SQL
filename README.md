# Alzheimers-dataset-SQL


## Executive Summary:

  Searched an Alzheimers dataset using SQL to see if there was any root cause to Alzheimers from the provided data. The data observed was age, family history, head injury, diagnosis, ethnicity, and alcohol consumption. In doing so the search was for finding if what behaviors persons with alzheimers had that may have contributed to the disease.



### Business Problem: 

  Alzeimers is an awful illness that is developed as we aged and is a progress form of dementia causing us to have loss of memories, decline cognitively, and go through behavior changes. This form of dimentia is intense and has no known root causes to why it forms in some of the population. This dataset was used to see if any behvior while in youth could cause someone as they become older to be diagnosed with alzheimers.



### Methodology: 

1. SQL query that extracts and transforms the data from the database.
   
2. Data visuals built within BigQuery

3. Analysis looking at individual components extracting percentages of qualities


### Skills:

SQL: simple queries

Data visualization: bar chart




### Results & Business Recommendation: 

  After viewing the results from the dataset I can cinclude that the root cause of alzheimers is still unknown. When looking at family history and people who are diagnosed with alzheimers the was a 32% chance for those with family history to be diagnosed with alzeimers. The starting age for patients with alzheimers went from the starting age of 60 to the age of 90. Alcohol at a higher rated consumption had less diagnosis than that of alcohol consumption while smokers had less diagnosis than non-smokers did. When looking at ethnicity there were 4 categories which included: Caucasian, African American, Asian, and other, with Asian being the most likely ethnicity to be diagnosed with 40.78% and other being the least likely at 31.54%.




Because so many of the values were not significant one way we can assume:

1. That the root cause of alzheimers is still unknow
2. The ethnicity with the most likely chance of getting alzheimers is those who are Asian descendants
3. Alcohol consumption and head injury is not the root cause of alzeimers but still may contribute in some way.
4. We need to collect more data that would most likely lead to the disorder in the brain

I believe many factors will contribute to the disorder obviously it comes with age but there still may be one main cause to alzheimers we haven't collected the data from and if we ever do it will help to reduce how many patients will get alzheimers.

### Next Steps: 

1. Collect more data related to brain deterioration
2. Analyze Asian decendents comparing them to other ethnicities
3. Retest the data again and again until the main cause of alzheimers is found.
